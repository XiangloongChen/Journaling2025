I went hiking with my high school classmates today. We visited Meixi Lake and Meihua Mountain. The lake is even larger than the one in Yanghu Wetland Park, and the mountain was beautiful — especially under such a sunny sky. After that, we had Jiangxi cuisine for lunch. Then we headed to the city center, Huangxing Square.

To be honest, I had never really been to these places before — maybe just passed by once — so the whole experience felt refreshing to me.

As usual, I felt very sleepy in the afternoon. So as soon as I got home, I took a nap, and I felt much better afterward.

At 7:00 p.m., I joined a Popcorn Club session hosted by a British guy. I think I met him once before at Popcorn Club back in Shanghai. There were only three people in the session including the host and me, but I think we still had a high-quality discussion. For me, three or four participants is the ideal number; any more than that, and the interaction becomes weaker, and I get far fewer chances to speak. The host asked us many open-ended questions, which is perfect for practicing IELTS speaking.

However, even though Popcorn Club is great, I still need to find some local offline cross-cultural meetups and visit shops or restaurants run by foreigners. Maybe I can even look for job opportunities related to English, because I noticed that I felt quite confident in the last two online sessions, and I genuinely enjoy communicating in English.

Don’t wait — just do it tomorrow, or even tonight.
