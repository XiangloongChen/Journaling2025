Overall, I felt pretty good today, probably because I slept well last night and also took a good nap this afternoon.

However, I did feel some discomfort in my stomach after drinking water last night. I guess eating an entire naan was beyond what my stomach could handle. Another lesson learned.

This morning, I went to Houhu International Art Park (后湖国际艺术区). The park has a beautiful lake and is very close to the metro station — you can see the lake immediately after stepping out of the station. And it’s only five stops away from my apartment. I love this park; it’s definitely a place I’d like to visit more than once.

It’s always refreshing to explore different parks, malls, or museums. Since I’m not working right now, I should probably visit all the major parks, big malls, and museums in Changsha. It’s good for my mood and good for my health.
