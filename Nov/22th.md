What a perfect day — sunny, warm, and with a clear blue sky! I went to Houhu International Art Park again this morning and played basketball with the guy I met last time. It would’ve been a waste not to go outside on such a beautiful day.

As for my energy level, it wasn’t bad today. I slept well last night and took a 30-minute nap in the afternoon.

When I’m energetic, playing sports makes me feel even more alive. I truly love that feeling of taking a warm shower after an intense and exciting basketball game.

I genuinely hope my digestion issues can be cured by next year, so I can “fly” again instead of barely being able to “run,” like I am now.

Once again, in my definition, a happy life means staying healthy, having enough money to live a decent life, building good relationships — whether romantic, friendly, or familial — and enjoying hobbies, creating things, or building something meaningful.
