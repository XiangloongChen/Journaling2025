Today was another wonderful day—warm and sunny. The only downside was the fatigue and sore muscles, probably because I played too hard the day before yesterday. I couldn’t even finish my exercise routine this morning.

For breakfast, I had fish rice noodles.

After breakfast, I went to the west side of the city. One of my close friends—my high school classmate—recently moved to his parents-in-law’s home with his wife. He invited us to hang out there yesterday, so I went over today. He lives near Hunan First Normal University, and we walked around together. We visited two nearby campuses: Hunan First Normal University and Hunan International Economics University.

My friend was really thoughtful. He bought a sugarcane for us the moment I arrived. We enjoyed the sweet sugarcane while walking around, chatting casually under the warm sunshine. It felt relaxed and enjoyable—we had a great time.

He also invited me to have lunch with his family, but my body still hadn’t fully recovered due to my ongoing gastritis, so I chose to go home for lunch.

As soon as I got home, I took a nap because I felt quite tired, as I mentioned earlier.

For lunch, I made a quick and simple dish—stir-fried cabbage. I ate it with a salted duck egg and rice.

At 4:00 p.m., I joined a Popcorn Club online session. It has been almost half a year since I last joined one. Today’s session went well—the topic, the host, and even my speaking all felt pretty good. I really hope I can recover fully soon so I can participate in more local cross-cultural events and meetups.

I’ve noticed that I don’t feel as tired or dizzy when I significantly reduce my screen time. Exercising, walking, or chatting with someone helps relax my eyes, brain, and nerves.

At 6:30 p.m., I went to get a haircut. It always feels refreshing afterwards.

Again, being happy isn’t that complicated: stay healthy, have enough money (not too much), maintain good relationships—whether romantic, friendly, or familial—and enjoy good weather.
