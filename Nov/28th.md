I went to a new park this morning — Yuehu Park (月湖公园). It’s not as beautiful or as clean as Houhu Park or Xihu Park, but I love the vibe there. Some elderly people were playing instruments, and I also noticed quite a few young girls in the park, which was different from the other parks I’ve been to — probably because it’s close to a university.

I did English video shadowing in the park today, and my work got some attention on the shadowing app. The positive feedback really motivated me to keep practicing and to continue posting these videos on TikTok and Douyin. It’s pretty fun and also a visible, trackable way to improve my English pronunciation.

It always feels fulfilling to look at the work I’ve accumulated day after day — seeing the progress adds meaning to everything I do. I should write more (which also means reading more), and publish more (videos and photos) — just like Naval and Dan Koe say: build your brand, build your capital, work for yourself instead of getting stuck in a 9–5 job, or even worse, a 996 job.

So what am I waiting for? Just go for it. Learn new skills, start small, get feedback, explore widely, and find what interests me most. 🔥
