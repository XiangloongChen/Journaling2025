Starting today, I’m going to write my diary in English.

I woke up pretty early again this morning — around 6 a.m.

For breakfast, I made meat and egg noodles. They turned out really good — simple but tasty. I liked them a lot.

As usual, I went to the nearby KFC after breakfast to work on my IELTS prep. I almost finished what I planned to do today. I think I can start studying the official materials and going through some real IELTS tests soon.

For lunch, I made stir-fried cauliflower with meat. I tried a slightly different way of cooking it this time. The taste wasn’t bad, just not as good as I expected. At least the cauliflower wasn’t watery anymore, but both the meat and the cauliflower were a bit tough to chew.

I took a nap after lunch, around 3:40 p.m., and continued studying IELTS materials after I woke up until about 6. Then I took out the trash and went for a short walk nearby.

Oh, and there’s one more thing I almost forgot to mention — one of my former colleagues (we used to work together at TikTok) messaged me on WeChat today. It’s been almost six months since I left the company, and he told me that our old department has been dissolved.

To be honest, I kind of saw it coming — even half a year or a year ago, I had a feeling this might happen someday. Nothing lasts forever. But we can always keep growing. Keep learning, stay curious, and stay open-minded.
