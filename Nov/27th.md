I went to Houhu Park again this morning. I finished my listening practice and an IELTS speaking mock test while walking around the lake.

After my nap, I went to play basketball, but I don’t know why I felt like I had no energy—especially in my legs. It was really frustrating.

I tried half of the pomelo I bought from Xiaoxiang (小象) yesterday. It tasted just as good as the expensive ones from the fruit stores and supermarkets, but it cost only about half the price.
