I felt fatigued and sleepy again today — I woke up at 6:30 in the morning and had only a shallow nap in the afternoon.

But I still need to stay positive and do something meaningful. So I went to Houhu International Art Park again. I walked along the lakeside road while watching some English videos on TikTok, and I listened to English podcasts on the metro ride there and back. I watched a lot of English videos and listened to many English podcasts today — even while I was cooking. I tried to immerse myself in a fully English environment.

I realized that TikTok is actually a great tool for learning English because it offers a huge amount of English content, and its recommendation algorithm always brings you videos you genuinely enjoy. I came across a video by Steve Kaufmann today — he’s a well-known polyglot. What he said really resonated with me: “You don’t need drills, word lists, or flashcards to learn a language. What you really need is interest.”
