It was another good day — sunny and warm!

I planned to switch to a different park today, so I had a simple breakfast — milk oatmeal, steamed fish, and an orange — so that I could set off earlier than usual.

After breakfast, I went to Xihu Park, a large park with an even larger lake. It’s surrounded by mountains, residential buildings, and office buildings, and there’s even a mall right by the lakeside.

It felt truly refreshing and exciting to explore a new park. I love nature, especially lakes, rivers, or the sea — they are perfect places to go on sunny days.

I really enjoyed the sunshine today. The only flaw is still my health condition. Anyway, tomorrow is another day. We can live each day as if it’s the best version of ourselves so far.
