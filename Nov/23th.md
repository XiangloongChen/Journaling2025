It was another good day — warm and sunny.

I felt a bit of soreness in my arm and hip when I got up, probably because I played such an intense basketball game yesterday.

I went to Houhu International Art Park again this morning. This was my fourth visit in a row. I really love this park.

I took a pretty good nap after lunch — about 30 minutes — and I felt much clearer mentally when I woke up.

Around 5:20 p.m., I went for a walk along the nearby riverside. This time, I read while walking, and I really enjoyed that moment of reading outdoors. I was even thinking that maybe I can also read while walking in the park tomorrow morning. And perhaps it’s time for me to switch to a different park for a change of scenery.

Recently, I’ve noticed that certain thoughts come to me naturally when I’m walking in parks. For example, I’ve gradually begun to figure out the kind of person I want to become — a writer, a filmmaker, a photographer, a designer, and a tutor.
