Today’s theme is still SUNNY DAY and PARK TIME.

I made **stir-fried pork ribs with green peppers** for lunch. I love this dish — it’s probably my top one on the menu — and it tasted as good as always.

I took a deep nap this afternoon, from **3:40 p.m. to 5:15 p.m**. Even when I woke up at 5, I still wanted to keep sleeping, but I didn’t want to ruin my sleep tonight, so I forced myself to get up. To be honest, I haven’t had such a deep nap for a long time — probably a year.

I really miss this feeling. Three years ago, or even earlier, every time I had a deep nap on weekends, my mind would become much clearer and lighter afterward. I would usually go play basketball or go to Popcorn Club to practice English.

It’s really annoying that I still felt some discomfort in my stomach today.

**What’s the meaning of life?**
For me, it’s being present, taking care of yourself — physically and mentally — and enjoying life.
