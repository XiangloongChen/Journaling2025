I went to watch a CBA game at Helong Gymnasium this afternoon. It’s really a blessing that we can enjoy a high-level game here in Changsha, given that we don’t even have a local CBA team.

But the drawback was that most of the star players didn’t show up. And the two older men sitting on both sides of me had a strong smell of alcohol, which was unbearable. Even worse, the man on my right and the one next to him both kept shaking their legs, making the entire row vibrate. It was really annoying.

Overall, the atmosphere and viewing experience couldn’t compare with the game I watched in Shanghai two and a half years ago.

On my way to Helong Gymnasium, one of my former colleagues messaged me on WeChat. We chatted a bit about my gap-year life, and she said she wanted to visit me. I declined directly with the excuse of my illness. Sometimes, we really need to set clear boundaries. If you don’t want something deep down, just say no.

I also came across a video about learning English today, and I completely agree with what the creator said. Combined with Steve Kaufmann’s suggestions, I think there are some natural ways to improve English:

1. **Immerse yourself in an English environment.** The best method is to talk to native speakers. If that’s not possible, switch your Chinese apps to English platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, Medium, Spotify, etc.). Read only English books, listen to English podcasts, watch English videos and movies, leave comments, and interact with people.

2. **Vocabulary is fundamental**, but instead of memorizing deliberately, learn new words through massive input—reading, watching, and listening.

3. **Interest is your strongest motivation.** The brain loves novelty. Study enjoyably rather than forcing yourself to study hard. Use the apps above to create an engaging learning flow.

4. **Good pronunciation builds confidence and improves listening.** Build a solid foundation by mastering the basic pronunciation units. Shadowing and impersonation help train your mouth muscles to adapt to English sounds more naturally.

5. **Retelling is a powerful method** for improving expression and paraphrasing.

6. **Input a lot, then output.** If you don’t have many chances to speak with native speakers, writing journals is a great form of output. Interacting on English social media is also practical and enjoyable. **The more you output, the more you’re driven to input. The more you input, the better your output. It’s an interplay — a positive cycle.**
