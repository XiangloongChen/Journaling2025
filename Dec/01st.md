I woke up very early again this morning — around 5 o’clock. It’s really annoying.
Maybe I should change my routine: get up at 5 a.m. and go to bed before 9:45 p.m.

Today marks the beginning of the last month of this year. It’s time to pick up my IELTS preparation again.

Here’s what I learned today:

Write every day and read a lot.
Treat your body like the house you live in.
You’re never too old to learn.
Double down on your strengths.
Find the right spouse.
