After spending a few days observing China-related discussions on Twitter/X, I realized something: there’s no point in arguing with people who already hold deep stereotypes or prejudices. If someone is determined to see things a certain way, debates won’t change their mind. Reality itself is the best explanation, and the best thing we can do—as Chinese people, and as individuals—is simply to live well and keep building a better life.

This mindset applies to personal growth too. We don’t need external validation. Just stay confident, keep evolving, create meaningful work, and let results speak for themselves.

It reminds me of the prayer:

> *O God, give us the serenity to accept what cannot be changed,
> the courage to change what can be changed,
> and the wisdom to know the one from the other.*

Starting tomorrow, I want to spend more time on things that truly matter, instead of getting dragged into political content or anti-China debates online. It’s a waste of energy to argue with people who refuse to understand. Changing others is difficult—changing ourselves is possible.
