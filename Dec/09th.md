# Tue, Dec 9, 2025 · Sunny but Hazy 🔆🌫 · 8–19°C

It’s always refreshing to visit new places. I was originally on my way to Houhu Park—already on the metro—when I impulsively decided to get off one stop earlier at Youth Square (恰同学少年广场), near the Xiangjiang River (湘江). When I walked out of the station, I realized I had actually been there before, but only passed by on a bike during the National Day holiday. I remember the place was packed with tourists back then. Today, there were only a few.

The square itself is not big, and the weather was sunny but foggy—actually, it was probably haze, not fog. Overall, it wasn’t the best experience. The only thing that caught my interest was a tour bus I’d never seen before. It looked new and unfamiliar to me.

I wrote for another hour this morning—applause for myself. I feel this is becoming a meaningful and valuable daily habit. It stimulates my thinking and helps me improve my ability to articulate myself in the long run. Dan Koe said it well in his tweet:
If you can't articulate yourself, it will be difficult to get what you want in life.
Customers won't care about your product.
Employers won't give you a raise.
Readers won't give you their attention.

Yesterday, I set a “time-bound constraint” for my daily reading: 30 pages per day. But this morning, I realized that wasn’t a practical goal—and it didn’t even align with the concept of a time-bound constraint. Reading effectively matters more than reading quickly. We need time to digest and apply what we read—thinking, commenting, practicing.

So instead, reading two to three hours a day is enough. How many pages I finish doesn’t matter. This also fits better with my “time boundary/constraint” principle.

It has been more than six months since I left Shanghai, so today I tried to withdraw all the money from my housing provident fund. To my surprise, I received the money just four minutes after submitting the application. That was incredible. Big shout-out to the Shanghai Provident Fund Management Center! Now the only thing left is deciding how to handle this large amount of money. I need to be careful.
