This morning, I visited my grandma. She’s going to Hengyang this weekend to stay at my aunt’s place for a while. Recently, I’ve been thinking about interviewing her, but I’m not prepared yet. Maybe I can do it next time.

I was quite active on TikTok today. I interacted with many people in the comments. I also came across some blindly anti-China comments under non-political videos and ended up debating with them. As a Chinese person, I feel I should counter these ignorant remarks that demonize China. And honestly, it’s also a practical way for me to practice English.

I learned a lesson today as well: don’t waste your time on negativity, including toxic people. Don’t try to play the piano in front of a cow.
