I wrote for an hour after waking up this morning, and I felt like I was in a flow state. The sense of fulfillment afterward was real. I’m thinking of making this a daily routine.

I’m not sure why I had some stomach discomfort after breakfast. My digestion didn’t work well today. Even after more than half a year of rest and treatment, these issues still hit me from time to time. It’s really frustrating.

I felt a bit guilty tonight because I ended up scrolling Douyin for two hours. I actually started off reading a book after getting home, but somehow I drifted onto my phone—and suddenly two hours were gone. But at the same time, I was happy, because I genuinely enjoyed those music videos. They even sparked an interest in learning Cantonese and maybe learning to sing some new songs.

If something feels cool to you, that’s what matters most. Learn the skill, practice relentlessly, refine your craft, and make it your own. Whether it’s a new language, singing, blogging, filmmaking, or photography—if it feels cool in your eyes, claim it and grow with it.
